# 2025-04-23-R-basic

ELIXIR-EE training course on R and RStudio basic usage. Targeted at learners who have little or no prior experience with R and RStudio.

The main document of the lecture is the [R-basic.Rmd](R-basic.Rmd) R Markdown document. R Markdown allows code examples and explanations/documentation to be in the same document in a nicely formatted, well-structured manner.

Data files needed in the code are located in the `data` folder.

## Learning Outcomes for the Training

1.  **Understanding Basic R Data Structures**:

    -   Learners will be able to distinguish between primary R data structures, namely vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists.

    -   They will be proficient in initializing and inspecting these structures using basic R functions.

2.  **Data Transformation with Tidyverse**:

    -   Participants will gain proficiency in using the **`%>%`** pipe operator to chain together functions for data manipulation.

    -   They will understand and be able to apply essential tidyverse functions like **`mutate`**, **`group_by`**, **`summarize`**, and **`arrange`** to transform and analyze datasets.

3.  **Data Categorization and Conditional Operations**:

    -   Trainees will be equipped to generate new variables in a dataset based on conditional logic, such as categorizing numerical data into distinct groups.

4.  **Application of Data Manipulation Techniques**:

    -   By the end of the session, participants will have hands-on experience in applying the introduced concepts to real-world datasets, such as the Kaggle "Memory Test on Drugged Islanders Data" dataset. They'll be able to group data, compute summary statistics, and create new columns based on specific criteria.
